Checking integrity of Schematic "C:\Users\aaron\Dropbox\EE445L\lab8\small_edits_unrouted\lab8_scheme_restart_2.sch" with PCB "C:\Users\aaron\Dropbox\EE445L\lab8\small_edits_unrouted\lab8_scheme_restart_2.pcb".

The PCB and Schematic designs do not match.
To bring them into line, you will need to make the following changes to the PCB design:

Component 'HD44780' package 'SIL14' in PCB is newer version than Schematic, use Update Component to correct this.
Component 'SmallPot' package 'SIP' in PCB is newer version than Schematic, use Update Component to correct this.
