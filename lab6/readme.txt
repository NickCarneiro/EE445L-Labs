If you want to build new parts or edit parts in this library, I suggest you create a new library. This way, when the EE345L TAs and professors add new stuff to this library, you can upgrade without loosing your edits.
1) Open Library manager
2) Select the "Schematic Symbols" tab, execute "New Lib..."
3) Select the "PCB Symbols" tab, execute "New Lib..."
4) Select the "Components" tab, execute "New Lib..."
You can edit an existing part and save it into your library. 

If it seems to be getting the wrong footprint
1) Click the Library tool (big blue book), opens Library manager
2) Select the "Folders" tab
3) Move EE345L to the top of the list
4) Close library manager
