# UTexas EE445L Labs

This repo contains labs for Bard's class in various states of completion. All 445L classes work from the same lab manual. Most of these are just the starter files and partial solutions, but if you look around you might find some helpful examples. The most interesting project is the final lab, a game for playing Pong on the C32.

If you have 445L code, send me a pull request and I'll add it here.
